                                                in hosting the TeKnoWave program benefit from the training received by students through the community internship work placement project which is performed at the end of the training component of the TeKnoWave
                                                program.

                                                financial benefits accruing to the community at large as a result. The average value of a community internship project has been acknowledged to be $20,000, reflecting a contribution of $10,000 per student.
                                                With a target of 1,000 IT professionals, TeKnoWave can deliver $10 million dollars worth of applications through the community internship component to groups who could not otherwise afford such system support.
